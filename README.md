- 👋 Hi, I’m @sviosdi, I am a French who knows russian language.
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing focused on Russian&French languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Javascript, Ajax, node.js (with Express)... and NLP, algorithms (nice courses from coursera.org)
- 💞️ I’m looking for someone, russian native speaker would be nice, who would like to work with me on a russian-french translator from ground up.
- 📫 You can reach me by mail : sviosdi@yandex.ru

Work done so far :

* Implementation of a JSON parser in C++.
* Implementation of Signal&Slot in C++, that enable a Signal (with templated parameters) to be connect to any function or method of a class, and be automatically disconnected when the connected object is distroyed.
* Implementation of an HTML parser in javascript-node.js to get the DOM of an html document.
  * Currently working on a way to automate the reading of russian words on wiktionary.org to automatically retrieve all information about a russian word and store it as a JSON document. Then find  later a way to store it in BSON format to be used in a self-made database (still to write), that would serve as morphologic database for russian words.
